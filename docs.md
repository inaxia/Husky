## What's the difference between `event` & `command`?

> @Husky.event <br>
Event is a piece of code that is triggered when the bot detects something has happened

> @Husky.command() <br>
Command is a piece of coed which is triggered when a user tells the bot to trigger


## Another way of getting bot's information
> print("{0.user}".format(Husky))
> print("{0.user.avatar_url}".format(Husky))
